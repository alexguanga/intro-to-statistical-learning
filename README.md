About:

After hearing many podcasts and books recommend this book, I decided to give it a try. This book is very descriptive on many machine learning concepts. The book also does not have a big emphasis on the mathematics. Rather, it gears on pushing the big picture rather than the details.

As a student of life, I have taken online courses. However, this is the first textbook that I am using to refine my machine learning knowledge. Thus far, it's been great. One of the drawback, which could be a positive for you, is that it's in R. While R does have its use in Machine Learning, I have enjoyed Python much more.
